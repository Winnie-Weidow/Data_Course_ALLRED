This is my second official edit. The first ones were confusing.
This is my third commit. Things are looking up for me.
Fourth commit - totally gonna get the hang of this.
Fifth commit. Doing this from memory so I can test myself. Cheerio.
This is my 6th commit. My memory is slowly improving. I feel like I'm writing a jounal entry on a deserted island.
This is my 7th commit. I can feel myself going crazy. Nobody around me knows what they're doing. Maybe someday we'll feel more smart than crazy.
This is my 8th commit. I'm still making mistakes, but I think I feel myself calming down. My head is still cloudy, but that could be from the extra caffeine I had yesterday.
This is my 9th commit. I hear the professor talking about some things to the guys across from me, and now I'm second guessing myself. Darn.
This is my 10th commit. Let's hope I'm doing it all correctly. I might need a drink... this weekend. Don't want one now.
I'm gonna do a bonus commit, just because I don't know if the first one counted. Maybe I'm gonna find a way off of this desert island.
Daily practice for pushing changes to cloud.
I wanted to try one more time. I'm glad I remembered how to do this without having to refer to notes.
