This is my second official edit. The first ones were confusing.
This is my third commit. Things are looking up for me.
Fourth commit - totally gonna get the hang of this.
Fifth commit. Doing this from memory so I can test myself. Cheerio.
This is my 6th commit. My memory is slowly improving. I feel like I'm writing a jounal entry on a deserted island.
This is my 7th commit. I can feel myself going crazy. Nobody around me knows what they're doing. Maybe someday we'll feel more smart than crazy.
This is my 8th commit. I'm still making mistakes, but I think I feel myself calming down. My head is still cloudy, but that could be from the extra caffeine I had yesterday.
