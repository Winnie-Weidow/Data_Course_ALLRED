list.files(path = "Data/", pattern = "\\.csv$", full.names = TRUE)
#path = "Data/" specifies the directory where we are searching for files.
#pattern = "\\.csv$" filters files to only those that end in .csv. The double backslash (\\) is necessary to escape the period since it's a special character in regular expressions.
#full.names = TRUE gives the full path to the files, not just their names.

csv_files = list.files(path = "Data/", pattern = "\\.csv$", full.names = TRUE)
#all files that end in .csv are stored in an object called csv.files.

length(csv_files)
#32 files match the description.

read.csv('Data/wingspan_vs_mass.csv')
df = read.csv('Data/wingspan_vs_mass.csv')
#all file contents stored as object 'df'

head(df, 5)
#head(x, n); x = obj name; n = #of lines

list.files(path = 'Data/', pattern = '^b', recursive = TRUE, full.names = TRUE)
#pattern = "^b" looks for files that begin with the letter "b" (the ^ indicates the start of the filename).
#recursive = TRUE tells R to search through all subdirectories of Data/.

b_files = list.files(path = 'Data/', pattern = '^b', recursive = TRUE, full.names = TRUE)
#all files that begin with b are stored in object b_files.

getwd()
#shows current directory. I needed to search files within the Data_Course_ALLRED directory. I will set this as my directory in the for-loop.

for (file in b_files) {
  setwd('/Users/winni/Data_Course_ALLRED')
  first_line <- readLines(file, n = 1)
  print(first_line)
}
#This loop will Iterate over each file in b_files, Read the first row of the file, and Print the first line of each file.

for (file in csv_files) {
  setwd('/Users/winni/Data_Course_ALLRED')
  first_line <- readLines(file, n = 1)
  print(first_line)
}
#This loop works the same way as the previous one.
